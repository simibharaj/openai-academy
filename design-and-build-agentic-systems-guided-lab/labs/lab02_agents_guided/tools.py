Exercise tools for the Agents Lab.

Read `labs/lab02_agents_guided/README.md` for the end-to-end instructions.
These functions are MOCK implementations to practice validation, error handling,
and consistent outputs for an agent that calls tools.

Implementations guidance (do during the exercise):
- Validate and sanitize inputs; raise `ValueError` for missing/invalid arguments.
- Keep outputs concise and user-friendly; avoid leaking internal details.
- Do not call external services; keep all data clearly marked as mock.

If you are stuck, consult `tools_solution.py` for reference only. Do not copy it directly.
