"""
Baseline single-agent exercise for the Agents Lab.

Read the end-to-end instructions in `labs/lab02_agents_guided/README.md`.
This file focuses on a minimal baseline agent and a tiny harness for manual checks.

TODO (implement in this exercise):
- Update and validate tools in `tools.py` so the agent can answer realistic questions
  (order lookup/cancellation, complaints, payment methods, and FAQs).
- Refine the system prompt so the agent asks for missing information, calls one tool at a time,
  and returns concise, user-friendly answers.
- Register the full tool set in `build_baseline_agent()` once implemented.
- Keep `run_once()` single-turn and simple.
- (Optional) Add session persistence with `SQLiteSession` for short multi-turn memory.

If you are stuck, review `agent_solution.py` only as a reference. Do not copy it directly.
You can review traces at https://platform.openai.com/logs/trace while iterating.

    Notes for the exercise:
    - Start with a minimal set (e.g., `check_payment_methods`).
    - After implementing the rest of the tools in `tools.py`, register them here
      (e.g., lookup_order, cancel_order, raise_complaint, FAQ_retrieval).
    - Keep the system prompt concise and focused on asking for missing info,
      calling one tool at a time, and returning short final answers.
