# Router composition exercises for the Agents Lab.

# Read `labs/lab02_agents_guided/README.md` for the end-to-end instructions.
# This module focuses on composing agents using:
# - Agent-as-Tool pattern (specialist agent exposed as a callable tool)
# - Triage routing with handoffs (CentralSupport hands off to specialists)
# - Input guardrails (security-and-topic validation with a tripwire)
#
# Guidance (do during the exercise):
# - Keep instructions explicit about when to delegate vs. handle directly.
# - Write clear `handoff_description` for each specialist to define routing scope.
# - Accept optional `input_guardrails` and pass them to the entrypoint agent.
# - Do not copy the solution; if stuck, reference `router_solution.py` only for hints.
