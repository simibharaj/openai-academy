# - You must define all required agent skeletons within the build_triage_routed_agents function.
# - This includes:
#     * The KnowledgeAssistant agent, exposed as a tool (see build_knowledge_assistant_tool).
#     * The OrdersAgent, responsible for all order-related requests (lookup, status, cancellation).
#     * The ComplaintsAgent, responsible for handling customer complaints and issues.
#     * The CentralSupport agent, which serves as the entry point and routes requests to the appropriate specialist agent or handles them directly.
# - Use the tools provided in tools.py for each agent's tools list.
# - Ensure that CentralSupport uses the KnowledgeAssistant as a tool and hands off to OrdersAgent and ComplaintsAgent as appropriate.
# - Write clear, complete docstrings and inline comments for each agent definition to explain their responsibilities and routing logic.
# - Follow the repository's conventions for agent construction and error handling.
